# Artificial Intelligence
The latest and greatest, computer science development, currently disrupting the 
technology and information stack of every sector and industry across the globe.

## What is Ai
Artificial Intelligence, simulates human intelligence. Ai refers to a machine 
(hardware and software) which performs a task that, would typically require; 
reasoning, perception & decision making. 

#### LLM | Large Language Model
The recent release and mainstream 
adoption of Open Ai ChatGPT, which is a Large Language Model. ChatGPT generates 
text, based on the User inputting a 'prompt'.

In the mainstream as of 24/04/2023 when people refer to Ai by in large they refer
to Open Ai ChatGPT, which is one of the first mainstream adopted AI text generation 
Bots. ChatGPT is essentially a SaaS product which uses a highly refined version Open Ai's 
davinci text model. ChatGPT has provided a nice UI for people to interact with artificial 
intelligence, coupled with it's practical application this has afforded ChatGPT to 
become know in the mainstream as Ai, much like Google became a word for search.

ChatGPT is an algorithm which generates text, based on the probability of what the response 
should be, to a question. the highly refined text-davinci model derives it's probabilities 
from it's training data, which consist of around 300,000,000,000 words structured in sentences,
paragraphs etc, from across the web. This means ChatGPT in basic terms; picks out keywords from your prompt 
and generates new text based on the highest probability of what it thinks your asking it to say. Based of all 
the text in it's training data which relates to your prompts specific keywords.

Now obviously im simplifying the technology here, but essentially it's; an algorithm ('lines of code') which uses 
it's 'memory' to generate new text, based on what the highest probability of what words should come next, given a prompt of words.

## Is AI sentient

***As we understand Sentience today I can say with 99% certainty AI is not sentient.***

The narratives that are circulating around TWTR and the rest of the internet about AI being sentient are largely are marketing ploy. 

Just like how individual and media companies, push narratives in financial markets (Think; BTC/Crypto, GME, Gold). **Think about it**, if AI was pitched in a factual 
rather than fictional way it would be much less interesting for the average consumer, fewer article clicks = less revenue.

That said my honest opinion is that AI is revolutionary and the application of things like LLM into the software industry is going to create a new 
generation of products, across the whole value chain in almost every industry that uses commercial software products.

In my opinion their are billions of dollars to be made solving practical problems for companies in the software space, using AI models to power the task performed by 
the software. 

This huge opportunity is going to attract some shady business, in the form of people trying to profit from the fear which some people have, and rightly so, around advances 
in technology reducing their value in the labour market. This fear pitch will be used to generate clicks.

This opportunity is little understood by the layman, their is a technical understanding of CS and engineering one must posses to have a vague understanding of how AI works. 
Which means many investors, much like in the late 90's tech boom/bubble, will pay ridiculous valuations for equity in companies solving problems in this space. The fact that 
It's a complex field which requires some technical understand of how computers and code works, many people can spread misleading narratives which sound impressive. Thats why 
I don't fear AI in the sense of it becoming sentient and 'taking over', however, whoever controls the algorithms which power AI models are built on is a very powerful person 
and could potentially use the power in nefarious ways which don't benefit society at large.
